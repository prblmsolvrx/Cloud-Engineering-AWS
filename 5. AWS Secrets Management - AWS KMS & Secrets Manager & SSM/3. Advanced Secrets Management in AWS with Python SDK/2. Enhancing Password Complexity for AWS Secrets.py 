"""
create a new secret with a random password. Initially, you are provided with a Python
script that generates a very simple string which is used as a password for a new Secret.
However, this implementation isn't very secure. Your task is to adjust the existing
code to ensure that the generated password is more complex, specifically it should be
16 characters long, including both lower and upper case characters, and without
the specific characters @, #, ", and /. Also, note that we do not want to include
any punctuation characters in the generated password.
