"""
Moving on to AWS services, in this task,
you will demonstrate the creation of custom
and default AWS sessions using Boto3, an important
aspect of working with AWS in Python. Amazon S3
is the service with which you are going to interact
in this task. Your job is to complete the given
script by creating a default S3 resource and client,
which will connect to AWS services using the default session.
The default session contains credentials and settings
from environmental variables, AWS credentials and config files,
or IAM roles for Amazon EC2 instances.
