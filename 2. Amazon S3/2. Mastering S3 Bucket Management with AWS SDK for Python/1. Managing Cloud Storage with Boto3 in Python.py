"""
Embark on a journey through AWS S3,
where you're tasked with organizing
your cosmic voyage memories and data
across the galaxy. In this scenario,
you will create three S3 buckets
located in different regions to
store photos from your intergalactic
travels in 2024, widget data, and
document archives from 2020.
Witness firsthand how to manage
these buckets within AWS: you'll
see the listing of all your created
buckets, perform a deletion operation
on one, and then observe the updated list of buckets.
Simply click Run to see these S3 operations in action,
showcasing the ease and power of managing cloud storage with AWS.
No coding is required on your part for this task;
enjoy watching your galactic storage system come to life!
Important Note: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's
state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator.
To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset
button located in the top right corner. However,
keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes.
To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
