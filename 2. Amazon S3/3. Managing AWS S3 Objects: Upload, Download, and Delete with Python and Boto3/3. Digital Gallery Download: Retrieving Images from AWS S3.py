"""
Hone your AWS S3 capabilities by
finalizing a script that interacts
with the cloud. A bucket named
'codesignal-digital-gallery' awaits,
intended to house 'prompt-engineering-course-logo.jpg'.
Your task is to complete the provided script
by adding the line necessary for downloading
this image into the "usercode/FILESYSTEM/Downloads"
directory. This step is key to mastering the
retrieval and management of cloud-based assets.

Important Note: Running scripts can alter
the filesystem's state or modify the resources
in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial
state, you can use the reset button located
in the top right corner. However, keep in
mind that resetting will erase any code changes.
To preserve your code during a reset, consider
copying it to the clipboard.
