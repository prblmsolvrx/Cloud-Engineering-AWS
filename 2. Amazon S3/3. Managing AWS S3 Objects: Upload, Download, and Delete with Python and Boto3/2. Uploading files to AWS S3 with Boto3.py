"""
Dive into AWS S3 with Boto3 by adding a new
picture to a digital gallery. Your job is to
finish up a script that sets up a bucket named
codesignal-digital-gallery and then uploads a
specific image file into it. To get started,
add the missing code to upload the image.
After running the script with the Run button,
you'll see the bucket being created, the image
getting uploaded, and a before-and-after list
showing what's in the bucket. This proves
your image is now part of the gallery.

Important Note: Running scripts can alter
the filesystem's state or modify the
resources in our AWS simulator.
To revert to the initial state,
you can use the reset button located
in the top right corner. However,
keep in mind that resetting will
erase any code changes. To preserve
your code during a reset, consider
copying it to the clipboard.
