"""
Dive into AWS S3's capabilities for
digital asset management using Boto3.
This exercise will take you through
the steps of uploading an image to an
S3 bucket, listing the objects in the bucket,
downloading the same image to a different
local directory, and then deleting the image
from the bucket.

Simply click Run to observe the process
in a simulated AWS environment.
No initial code writing is needed;
just review the code to see it in action.
After running the script, check the
/usercode/FILESYSTEM/downloads folder
to see the downloaded image.

Important Note: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator. To revert to the initial state, you can use the reset button located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that resetting will erase any code changes and downloaded files. To preserve your code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
