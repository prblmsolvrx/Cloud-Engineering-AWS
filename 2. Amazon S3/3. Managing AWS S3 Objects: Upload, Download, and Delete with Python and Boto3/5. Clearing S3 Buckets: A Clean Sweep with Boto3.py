"""
Embark on a journey to master AWS S3 bucket management using Boto3.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves a clean sweep
of the codesignal-learn-course-logos bucket, which is brimming with
logos from various CodeSignal Learn courses. Your task is to augment
the provided script by deleting all objects within the bucket before
removing the bucket itself, demonstrating your prowess in cloud
resource stewardship.

Important Note: Running scripts can alter the filesystem's
state or modify the resources in our AWS simulator.
To revert to the initial state, you can use the resetbutton
located in the top right corner. However, keep in mind that
resetting will erase any code changes. To preserve your
code during a reset, consider copying it to the clipboard.
